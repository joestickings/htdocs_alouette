        <h1>Members Achievements</h1>
        <p>At Alouette we are proud of our members, especially when they achieve a milestone in their flying. From a first solo, qualifying cross country to NPPL or PPL. On this page we list all of those member's achievements.</p>
        
        <ul class="contentList">
            
            <li>
                <h2>Gerry Chalmers</h2>
                <h3>IMC rating</h3>
                <p>&quot;No matter what decisions EASA and the CAA decide about our IMC rating; Gerry has one. Gerry passed the test today 6th June 2012 and now can show he has the life saving skills to fly in IMC. His training sometimes involved flights in some really dubious weather, yet his concentration always meant our safe return. Well done Gerry.&quot;</p>

                <h2>Merscidies Mamora</h2>
                <h3>First solo</h3>
                <p>Merscidies recently completed her first solo in our Cessna 172 G-BRAK. In her own words;</p>
                <p>&quot;I thank God for this achievement and that I am now part of the solo pilot family!&quot;</p>
                <p>Well done Merscidies! </p>

                <h2>Silet Torrente</h2>
                <h3>First solo</h3>
                <p>Silet recently completed his first solo, having had various delays due to pressure of work. He originally began flying in our old Tomahawk G-BMTO, which we no longer have, but did his solo in the PA28 G-BUJO.</p>
                <p>Like most people at Alouette, Silet just loves flying!</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Robbie Garrett</h2>
                <h3>NPPL</h3>
                <p>Having flown his first solo circuit on Friday the 8th of April, Robbie has again fallen foul of the weather gods when it came to his skills test.</p>
                <p>However Robbie no longer needs to flap his arms trying to fly – he has his own licence now! Having completed his training some weeks ago he suffered a long wait and  host of delays for his final test. His instructor Bruno disappeared for a week and so instructor Ian took him up for revision. Then the fog arrived – and stayed – and stayed. An examiner was on standby, the aircraft was sitting there but the weather was sour; the birds were walking! Well now that long wait is over, so congratulations to Robbie for gaining his NPPL.</p>
                <p>Bruno</p>

                <h2>Pete Thomson</h2>
                <h3>PPL with Night and IMC ratings</h3>
                <p>Having gained his PPL with Alouette, then his night rating, Pete has now completed his IMC rating with Ian Davidson, taking the test on Tuesday 27th September with Roger Patterson.</p>
                <p>Commenting on Ian's instruction Pete said "He is very good and pushes you to the limit. He certainly ironed out some of my bad habits!!".</p>
                <p>Well done once again Pete, its nice to know you have that IMC when you are in the left hand seat (or the right for that matter!).</p>

                <p>Congratulations are due to Jordan who passed his skill test on the 10th of July 2011 with examiner Roger Patterson.</p>
                <p>Jordan completed his first solo last autumn and went on to take the skill test with a total of just 50 hours under his belt.</p>
                <p>Well done and welcome to the Alouette achievers page.</p>

                <h2>Stefan Szaniszlo</h2>
                <h3>IMC and Night Ratings</h3>
                <p>Well done to Stefan for obtaining his IMC on Saturday 11th June 2011 when he passed the skill test with examiner Roger Patterson.</p>
                <p>Stefan also added a night rating to his licence, having carried out the necessary training with resident instructor Ian Davidson.</p>
                <p>Stefan completed his skills test with Alouette, and qualified as a PPL, on 24th April 2010 in just over 51 hours.</p>
                <p>Stefan took his first lesson on 28th September 2008, went solo on 7th June 2009 and completed his Qualifying Cross Country on 31st January 2010. Unusually, during his training Stefan started on the Tomahawk, then flew Echo Alpha and finally Alpha Kilo so has actually flown all the club aircraft, including two we don't have any more!</p>

                <h2>Tom Wheeler</h2>
                <h3>PPL</h3>
                <p>The latest person to pass his Skills test at Alouette and join the pilots at Alouette is Tom Wheeler so many congratulations are in order.</p>
                <p>The following was written by his instructor, Bruno;</p>
                <p>Tom is a very busy person ! Seen at week ends at the Air Scouts hall at Biggin helping youngsters understand some aspects of flight; then starting a new job; finding time to train and study for a PPL; then having to take a flight test !!!!</p>
                <p>This all came together today, Saturday 16th April, and Tom passed his skills test ! Well done Tom ! Typically, having achieved a life long ambition, he simply went back to the Scout hall and continued to help others. (I was tempted to say "What a guy" but it sounded a bit over the top !)</p>

                <h2>Adrian Biesty</h2>
                <h3>First solo</h3>
                <p>Adrian did his first solo last Tuesday 8th March 2011.</p>

                <h2>Paul Cartwright</h2>
                <h3>PPL</h3>
                <p>Paul completed his PPL Skills test with our CFI and examiner Don Beard on Wednesday 5th May 2010 having carried out his training with instructor Bruno Bruniges. Paul overcame the vagaries of working shifts, including night work to concentrate on the studies and the practical side of flying. He has also been seen at the Club updating paperwork, graphs, charts and making flight planning a bit easier for us mere mortals. Once Gatwick issues his licence you will no doubt be seeing him enjoying his new found freedom.</p>

                <h2>Suleyman Hassan ("Solly")</h2>
                <h3>PPL</h3>
                <p>Solly worked hard through the summer and still found time to laugh and enjoy the flying.</p>
                <p>Working nights was a little tiring to say the least and much sleep was lost due to waking up just to find the TAF wasn't quite right and flying was cancelled. Yet his enthusiasm has proved its worth and now Solly can relax a little and enjoy his new found freedom in the air. Well done.</p>

                <h3>PPL</h3>
                <p>Well done to Eugeniu Namolovan having passed his skills test this June, 2009.</p>
                <p>Eugeniu has set himself high targets in his flying career and has shown determination by working in this country to pay for his training. His family at home in Moldova must be very proud of him.</p>
                <p>Like all students at Alouette his biggest problem during training was the British weather which as we know can be somewhat frustrating. Yet Eugeniu overcame this, as well as keeping shift work and travel commitments.</p>
                <p>Well done Eugeniu !</p>

                <h3>PPL</h3>
                <p>Many of you will know Richard, our club treasurer, and his sterling efforts to achieve his PPL. Well we are pleased to report that last Wednesday he qualified and we send our heartfelt congratulations to him. In his own words;</p>
                <p>“I’m grateful to all the members and instructors who tolerated, inspired and encouraged me to keep focusing on the end goal – I expect it’s a relief for everybody (especially my wife Kim)</p>
                <p>Looking forward to lots of recreational flying with friends and family and taking advantage of the opportunities that a PPL presents.”</p>

                <h3>PPL</h3>
                <p>With the dubious honour of being the first on this new page, our congratulations to Ying Li who passed his Skill Test at Alouette on 6th May 2008. Ying did his cross country to Lydd and Earls Colne and, shortly afterwards with the weather obviously on his side (!), completed the PPL(A) Skill Test.</p>
