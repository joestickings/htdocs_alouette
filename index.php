                <h2>We put the fun back into flying</h2>
                <p>Alouette is, first and foremost, a club which is run for the members, by the members. We have no employees which keeps our overheads low and allows us to keep the cost of flying down, an all-important consideration in these days of rising prices. Our flying rates are still among the cheapest in the South East of England!</p>
