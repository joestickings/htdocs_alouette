        <p>Trial lessons are of one hour duration with a qualified instructor and the recipient will spend most of this time at the controls of the aircraft. The flight will be from Biggin Hill and will return to Biggin Hill.   If the recipient subsequently decides to work towards qualifying for the Private Pilot’s Licence, this first lesson counts towards the flying hours required and can be entered in their Pilot’s log book - see below for our special offer to new students.</p>

        <p>Vouchers are valid at the price sold for a period of three months. Thereafter the club reserves the right to make a surcharge if our costs, notably that of fuel, increase significantly.  It is not necessary to book the date and time of the trial lesson when purchasing a voucher.</p>
        <p>If you book a trial lesson using PayPal we will be in touch shortly after by email to confirm your booking and discuss a suitable date/time for the flight. If you wish we can contact you by telephone but you will need to type your number, and any other relevant information, into the 'Add Special Instructions for the Merchant' link as PayPal's security policy prevent them from disclosing your number to us.</p>
        <p>If you prefer to discuss your trial lesson first, please contact <strong>Russell Dennis</strong> on <strong>07703 397 534</strong> Monday to Friday 0900-1800 or email him via <a href="mailto:bookings@alouette.org.uk">bookings@alouette.org.uk</a></p>
        <p>Alternatively, trial lessons can be given without buying vouchers. Bookings can be taken and the costs paid on the day, cash only please. For trial lessons paid for without vouchers, please contact Russell Dennis as above.</p>
        <p>Following your trial lesson we hope you will want to continue with your training and to this end we offer a special pack containing the initial items you will require to start your training. These contain the following;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Aircraft Check List</li>
            <li>Aircraft Handling Notes</li>
            <li>Pilot's Log Book</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These packs are intended for new students only, are offered at the preferential price of <strong>£15.00</strong> each and are available from your instructor.</p>
